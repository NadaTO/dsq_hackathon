## 1. Setup Metamask
1. Metamask is a ligh client for Ethereum. It allows for creation and managing of Ethereum wallets. Metamask is a browser extension, using Chrome, Firefox, Opera or Brave install Metamask from: https://metamask.io/
2. Once Metamask is installed it will prompt you to import or create new wallet, choose create new wallet, and choose a password for the new wallet.
3. Metamask uses a seedphrase to derive private/public key pairs (a Ethereum wallet is a private/public key pair). Use the default seedphrase that is provided by Metamask, but copy it somewhere as in the next step you are required to input the seedphrase once again for confirmation. 

4. Once the wallet is created open Metamask by clicking at the browser extension situated on the toolbar on the top right. By default Metamask uses Ethereum Main Network, change this by clicking on the label, from the dropdown choose Ropsten Test Network.


## 2. Request Ether & XBR
1. Click the menu icon in Metamask and click add new token
2. Click Custom Token, copy paste the XBR Token address and click next.
3. From Metamask, copy your Ethereum address and paste it on the chat.
